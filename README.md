I have created an API by using Python Flask  to use it inside of my some game module project. It is actually sending requests to YouTube to fetch MP4 data and converting it to MP3 and stores, serves the converted file as a respond to the client.

You may want to config WSGI for the deployment and for your own stuff.

`pip3 install flask `
